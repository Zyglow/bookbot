# Required for project
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

# My comments:
This is the first real (sort of) Pythn project from the boot.dev backend course.
It covers some basic concepts such as context management (although not directly called out), opening files, importing stl and custom libraries, and working with hashmaps (dictionaries).

I ended up make some changes such as currying functions, and using a tuple when the directions stated to use a nested dictionary.  Not saying my way is better, but using a lambda is using a lambda

# Final thoughts
Boot.dev does a great job for an online learning resource.  Unlink most out there, the platform doesn't give you the answer and looks for output formatting.  Many times learners must figure problems out ON THEIR OWN (imagine that)!  I really dig this approach as it provides a "real world" feel to the lessons.
